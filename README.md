# Covid-19-Detection-Through-CXR-Images

### Part of Summer Challenge Competition 2020 conducted in IIT Jodhpur
It predicts the probability of person being infected from Covid-19 or Pneumonia by analyzing the Chest Xray images of the patient.
Several Image features were made using Convolutional Neural Network and are trained on Machine Learning Classifiers.

For complete information of the project refer to **Covid-19 CXR Detection Report** which is uploaded here.
