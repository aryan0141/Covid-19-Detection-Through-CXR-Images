A website made through python Django framework, to detect the Coronavirus in Chest X-Ray images.
## Part of Summer Challenge Competition
Model is trained using Convolutional Neural Network, as well as machine learning classifiers.

This website, uses the already trained models, to classify CXR images.
#### Random forest, XGboost, K-Nearest Neighbor models are uploaded here. But the CNN model is not uploaded here, due to it's big size.
